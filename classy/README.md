#### Classy

This repo actually wasn't meant to be public but oh well.
If you use this plugin at this point I cannot guarantee for anything. Bugs might and probably are everywhere. Also the database layout itself is subject to change and no way of automatically upgrading it to newer versions might be provided.

Classy allows easily managing classes in IDA Pro. Vtables can be generated by selecting a range, functions can be assigned to classes, their signatures can be easily editing and mangled, IDA structs can be assigned, C headers can be generated, probably more :)

Credits to Ninji aka Treeki for the core idea and many code snippets from the plugin he created.
